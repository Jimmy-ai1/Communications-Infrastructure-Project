## Problem Statement

Despite significant growth in mobile technology adoption accross the world, there remains a disparity in access and usage of communcation devices among countries. Understanding the relationship between mobile phone penetration (number of phones per 100 people) and the number of subscribers can help identify regions with untapped potential, infrastructure gaps, or opportunities for targeted investment. This analysis aims to **provide insights** that can guide **policymakers, telcom companies, and development agencies** in **improving communication access and closing the digital divide.**

## Data Understanding

The data used in the analysis focuses on the **number of broadband subscribers** and the **mobile phone penetration in countries** in specific years.

## Results

**Countries outside Africa record higher broadband subscribers counts** compared to African countries. The leading countries tend to have **more advanced technological infrastructure and supportive regulatory environments that encourage broadband adoption**. In contrast, countries with the lowest subscriber numbers **may face challenges** such as** **limited infrastructure, lower affordability, or restrictive policies** that hinder service expansion.

The data shows **no strong correlation** between the number of broadband subscribers per 100 people and the number of mobile phones per 100 people.
In some markets, **high mobile phone penetration coexists with low broadband subscription rates** - likely due to **affordability constraints, reliance on mobile data, or limited fixed-line infrastructure**. These markets **present significant opportunities for telcom companies** to expand broadband services and capture untapped demand.

Between 2006 and 2010, **mobile phone penetration rose sharply before experiencing a gradual decline by 2016.**

Broadband subscriptions **grew steadily throughout the decade**, but saw a **slight drop after 2016**, which may be linked to the slowdown in mobile phone penetration. This suggests that **mobile access trends could play a role in influencing broadband adoption rates over time.**

## Conclusions

- **Countries outside Africa record more broadband subscribers than those within Africa**, proving that factors such as **technological infrastructure and regulatory envrionments** play a part in subscriber counts in a country
- There are some markets where **low subscriber counts coexists with high mobile phone penetration** likely due to affordability constraints.
- **Temporal trends** - Mobile phone penetration fluctuates with an increase from 2006 to 2010 and a gradual decline in 2016. Broadband subscriber counts gradually increased for a decade then experiencing slight drop after 2016.

## Insights

- Identify **regional laws that seem to be hindering the mobile phone penetration and telecommunication services**.
- Regional agencies and countries within Africa e.g. Burundi, can **reach out to private development agencies** for help in developing technological infrastructure.
- Telcom companies should **expand their services to those countries with low subscriber counts** especially within Africa.
